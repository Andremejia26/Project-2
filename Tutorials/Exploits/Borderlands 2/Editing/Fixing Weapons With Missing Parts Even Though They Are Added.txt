One of the major flaws when making modded weapons is that people
will know when you are using them just because of how they look
compared to other weapons. I still see a lot of people running 
around with weapons that are missing parts and is losing out
on potenial by wasting those slots. 

The 2 you will notice the most are Bodies and Materials.

When pasting a code and the body or Material is not unqiue
and has a _5 this will need to be removed and changed to 
_4. A Unique Weapon should have text before or after stating
that it is a unique part.

   ^ DLC parts are always unique 



Background info!
A long time ago a bug existed in Gibbed Borderlands 2 Where
the body and material wouldn't spawn in for the harpoon 
launcher weapon released in Hammerlocks DLC that wouldn't
let it spawn in due to a bug in the body and Material. 
After this was fixed bodies/materials labeled under _5
stopped working via the mission reward tab.
