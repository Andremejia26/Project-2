To me there is one part that stands out more than any other
and that would be the Fibber 2 barrel which I rate at OP
with a major flaw. 

+++Damge
++ Pellet Count
--- Weapon Reload Speed
-- can't be used with an infinity barrel


The damage increase from a fibber is one of the most insane
things I have personally ever seen in the game. However the
biggest flaw with the weapon part is the insane reload time
it adds to your weapons so make sure to use the roksalt in 
combo with this part if you don't want to spend a day 
reloading.

Suggest adding 1 to 1 so you won't spend your day reloading

Roksalt is not important just a suggestion
