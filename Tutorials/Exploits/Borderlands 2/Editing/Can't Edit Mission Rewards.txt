Well to put this lightly you ruined the save somewhat...

After creating a mission reward and playing the game
the save will not be able to be edited if any mission
data is changed during the game. This will prevent you
from even seeing the item that is listed in the mission
reward tab. However this can be semi bypassed with
loading save claiming rewards and then bringing into an 
editor or by going completely around it and making a 
secondary option to choose from (will consume even more
data).

Saves are still limited by the space they have on them
a heavily modded save with 100% of story completed can 
not hold enough data to have modded weapons and all 
story mode completed.
