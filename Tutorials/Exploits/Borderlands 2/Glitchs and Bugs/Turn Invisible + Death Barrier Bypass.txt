Much like the original glitch in the highlands this glitch 
is caused by going out of bounds.

When you first load into Caustic Caverns use a weapon to 
rocket jump into the air and over the wall behind you.

When looking down you will notice a green patch where the
acid is under the map. There is also 2 pieces of the wall 
sticking out once you get over it to show the jump area.
This glitch requires high velocity in order to hit the 
specfic spot so hitting the wall piece will make it 
harder due to the lack of momentum. Your goal is to aim 
for getting under the New-U-Station quickly. 

Jumping over the Bridge to the left of the spawn seems to
have a barrier bypass *requires long distance*.

- Your gun will be invisible if this worked 
- Dying removes the glitch
- Getting in a vechicle will make you visible
- Traveling you will stay invisible
- If a player joins after you will not be invisble on their
screen
