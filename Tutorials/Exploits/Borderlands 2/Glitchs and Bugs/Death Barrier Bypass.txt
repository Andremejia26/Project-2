Can be done without modded gear but it is a pain

Go to The Highlands - Overlook

Grab a vehicle and go to the first area after you 
beat the worm boss in the story. Procede to rocket-
jump up the mountain in front of you and stay on 
the right side until you get to the bar but 
continue to go up the high mountain not falling
off to the sides or else you can get stuck.

Fall off the back of the mountain just over 
where it starts dropping down on the far right side
if you land on the moutain this will be easier
if you fell try to stand still and slowly move left
After you land look for the section that starts going
or you notice doesn't have collision. Face the death 
tower and turn 30 to the right and sprint off the 
cliff and keep walking forward. 

Getting it is a lot harder to tell only + for this
glitch is being able to do it without mods
