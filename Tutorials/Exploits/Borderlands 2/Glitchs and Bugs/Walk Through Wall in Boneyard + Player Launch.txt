I call this glitch Harry Potter Meets NASA

Go to the Arid Nexus - Boneyard

Go Underneath pump station #2 
(The building connected to the mountain in front of spawn)

There is a rock in the left corner on the bottom of the
pumping station or the inner corner on the right side of
the wall spawner you can walk through the wall.
Follow the walkway you can fall down to until you see a
turn back sign. Keep walking and your character will fly
higher than the mountain.
