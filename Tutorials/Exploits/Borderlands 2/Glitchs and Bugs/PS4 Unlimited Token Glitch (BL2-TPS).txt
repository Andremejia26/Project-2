Requires badass rank of at least 1 to start. The higher yourbadass rank the more tokens you get.

If you aren't modding rank, tokens, or percent the values will look of the following:

RANK=TOKENS^1.8
LOG(RANK) = 1.8 * LOG(TOKENS)
LOG(TOKENS) = (LOG(RANK) / 1.8)
TOKENS = 10^(LOG(RANK) / 1.8)

TOKEN VALUES ARE ROUNDED!
