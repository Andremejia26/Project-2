IF IMPORTING DOES NOT WORK OPEN YOUR JSON FILE WITH NOTEPAD/JSON EDITOR AND COPY AND PASTE IT OVER YOUR SAVE IN ADVANCED MODE

No longer is an exploited console needed UNLESS you want modded skill trees to save. [This is why advacned mode was added due to save wizard checking the max value unlike the game]

It is now possible to convert PC saves to PS4 and back as well with the BL3-CLI tool thanks to this as well!
Fix Save Wizard Syntax!! You can change they key and value but Save Wizard will corrupt your save if you don't fix!
The JSON Editor below will bring you straight to the problem when you open the save! and let you know if something else is wrong!


"active_league_instance_for_event" does not yet exist within TTWL so there is no need to fix if you are here for wonderlands

If you get an error open your save with notepad and replace your fields with these.
You will also need a PC save to use as a host file. (click here for PC saves)


bl3-save-import-json -j PS4 -t PC.sav

bl3-save-edit -o json PC.sav PS4.json

PS4 will be your exported save
-t PC.sav will be your PC save
