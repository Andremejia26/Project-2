This requires a lot of lag in order to work properly.

Host needs to lag game via modded weapons or switching
bank tabs on sanctuary. 

Player joining needs to reset skill tree before joining
the host game to make sure they have all of their skill
points. After the player joins and starts lagging spam 
use skill points on all the skills they want and it
should not take any skill points away from them. If
it starts taking points have them leave and reset skill
tree again. If it does work have them go back in their 
game respec and do it again so they will get more skill
points in return.
