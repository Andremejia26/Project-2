Param info:

15C-163 = UUID (flip endian if you are using HxD and not a sfo editor [ https://jmacwhyte.github.io/hexflip/ ]).

9F8-9FF = Save Slot Value

If you are using Save Wizard to resign saves named 100 will not work so use slots 1-99 or alt to 1A, 2B, 3C, etc

PS5 seems to have an issue where copying a saves icon from a freshly created save on Save Mounter. This will prevent it from being made so you will have to make the slots yourself by creating saves within the game.


CSave is what helped this community out a lot especially after the passing of Baysix and between raptor adding PS4 support
Please give a big round of applause for HackerSmacker for making CSave.
