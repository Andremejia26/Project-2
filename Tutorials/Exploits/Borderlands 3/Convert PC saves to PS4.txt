Param info:
15C-163 = UUID (flip endian if you are using HxD and not a sfo editor [ https://jmacwhyte.github.io/hexflip/ ]).

9F8-9FF = Save Slot Value

If you are using Save Wizard to resign saves named 100 will not work so use slots 1-99 or alt to 1A, 2B, 3C, etc

PS5 seems to have an issue where copying a saves icon from a freshly created save on Save Mounter. This will prevent it from being made so you will have to make the slots yourself by creating saves within the game.
