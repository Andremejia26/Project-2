When making an eridium dropper there is a few steps that
need to be taken prior to starting the save. 

- Talk to clap-tr4p (Make a new game and not a new skipped game)
- Be a low level (level 1-2 [modding your level after adding will remove eridium])
- If you want to add a 500 eridium stack you need 1 regular eridium stack
