If you have droppable Eridium Save (can be downloaded in this pack) 
and want to share it with other players here is how to do so:

Make sure that the player that wants to recive the eridium is 
a fresh new character made in another players game that is not
in the very beginning of the game!

After joining the other player past the intro of the game have 
your friend send you the eridium stacks via Mail. 


If you want to keep the eridium on the character it is suggested
to backup the character to an external device!

Putting the eridium in the bank will only allow it to be used on 
another character because it is automatically used once removed
from the bank.

Playing the game with this save will automatically remove the
eridium from your backpack!
