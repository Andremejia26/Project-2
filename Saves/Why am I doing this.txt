Hello I thought it would be a little fun to write about saves as I made them! 
So here is dev notes on the saves!

Borderlands 3:

Slots 1-4
Save 1 was originally just planning on doing a 100% saves but I didn't want
to do the game over 100% so I will just look around online until I find something
Finally found a save to use from Apoc however I am already done with the first 
batch of eridium droppers found out that the 500 eridium is just part of the 
item data and can be changed as long as there is at least 1 eridium. This 
took up saves 1-4 since people was asking for more eridium 
Found out you can mail eridium by sending it a friend that has not started
the game but made a new level 1 character in another players lobby (can not
be at the start of the game or it will wipe everything). 
Found the issue with PS5 saves needing the ICON that are made fresh with save
mounter. Just make sure there is sce_icon0png0 and sce_icon0png1 

Slots 5-8
New season just going to add in the key droppers for the next few saves
and keep 1 empty since it is confirmed on having 3 seasons and made a backup
for key1 incase they decide to do something with it again. OFC added the Diamond
key dropper since this should be in everything after the directors cut.

Slot 9 + profile save
Everyone wants customizations so here you go :| not how I wanted to do this
but looking through apocs notes for obfuscating/deobfuscating the items/weapons
I was still unable to get the new ones to load properly so I just dumped everything 
from the saves on nexus and imported them into the character I got from apoc.
Dumping to a profile save was a pain seems apocs notes for bl3-save-edit are a bit
strange but got it working after 20 minutes since raptors tool doesn't seem to have
multi import function like bl3saveeditor (RIP Baysix <3)
