 Released Saves For The Borderlands Series Modded By Xcier-Freedom/ProtoBuffers
This Initial Save Release is for 8/1/21 and starting my new journy so I hope everyone
here wishes me luck in getting everything to work out on my end.


The credits list is to large to compile to thank everyone for their hardwork and tools
made over many years that I have used to edit saves or edit them, but I will try to 
sit down and make a full list soon!

It is highly recommended to NOT download everything at one time as this will being
getting a large amount of updates over time just go to the folder you want to download
something from and download the zip or raw .sav as well. 

If enough people want I will move the Borderladns tools over to thier own section!
Will most likely need to do this as well due to false postivies within the programs
due to obfuscation and network use for exploited consoles.

If you want to support me with a one time payment you can donate here (better for those
who want to remain anon [comes with a discord role if wanted]):
https://paypal.me/xcier
cashtag $xcier

I will be streaming soon and making videos so if you want your name displayed on screen
in the end or during a stream you can donate to me at that time as well with the donation
link in the discription.


If you want to support me for a monthly fee you will get early access behind the scenes, 
extra gear, discord roles, and more!
